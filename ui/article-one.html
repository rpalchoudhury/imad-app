                    SSH was designed as a replacement for Telnet and for unsecured remote shell protocols such as the Berkeley rlogin, rsh, and rexec protocols. Those protocols send information, notably passwords, in plaintext, rendering them susceptible to interception and disclosure using packet analysis.The encryption used by SSH is intended to provide confidentiality and integrity of data over an unsecured network, such as the Internet, although files leaked by Edward Snowden indicate that the National Security Agency can sometimes decrypt SSH, allowing them to read the contents of SSH sessions.

                    SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow it to authenticate the user, if necessary.There are several ways to use SSH; 
                    <ol>
                  <li>  one is to use automatically generated public-private key pairs to simply encrypt a network connection, and then use password authentication to log on.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Another is to use a manually generated public-private key pair to perform the authentication, allowing users or programs to log in without having to specify a password. In this scenario, anyone can produce a matching pair of different keys (public and private). 
                  </li>
                    </ol>
              
                <p>
                    SSH is typically used to log into a remote machine and execute commands, but it also supports tunneling, forwarding TCP ports and X11 connections; it can transfer files using the associated SSH file transfer (SFTP) or secure copy (SCP) protocols.SSH uses the client-server model.
